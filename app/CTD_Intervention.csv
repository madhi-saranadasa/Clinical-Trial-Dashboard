88,NCT04017312,Device,High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation,"High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) therapy (also known as high-frequency chest-wall compression or HFCWC) is commonly prescribed to provide routine airway clearance in patients with bronchiectasis as well as other patients with a need for regular airway clearance therapy. HFCWO generates high velocity expiratory airflow. This airflow is thought to mobilize secretions by the sheer force created, effecting changes in rheology and moving mucus in a cephalad direction during the oscillation. The Vest® Airway Clearance System, a commonly used device, generates HFCWO using an air pulse generator and an inflatable garment that delivers pressure pulses to the thorax. These pressure pulses within the garment create HFCWO."
89,NCT04017312,Device,Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP),"Oscillating PEP is an airway clearance technique, where the person blows all the way out many times through a device. These types of oscillating PEP devices work in two ways. Firstly, they use resistance to make it more difficult during the breath out, like non-oscillating PEP devices. Oscillating PEP devices also create vibrations when breathing out. The vibrations move mucus from the surface of the airways. After blowing through the device several times, the person will huff and cough to clear the mucus from the lungs."
