      The effect of comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy applications on respiratory function,&#xD;
      functional capacity and peripheral muscle strength in children with cystic fibrosis and&#xD;
      non-cystic fibrosis will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis may be a congenital cause such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or non-cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, post-infectious conditions, aspiration and&#xD;
      immunodeficiency; It is a disease characterized by irreversible dilatation of airways.&#xD;
      Symptoms; purulent sputum production, chronic cough, hemoptysis, recurrent fever and&#xD;
      pleurisy. Mucociliary clearance disorder secondary to inflammation and involvement of&#xD;
      exocrine glands in CF plays a major role in the development of symptoms; In non-cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB), the development of similar symptoms may occur regardless of&#xD;
      these reasons. However, in the examinations of CF, proximal airways; In NCFB, distal airways&#xD;
      have been affected more intensively. As part of pulmonary rehabilitation, comprehensive&#xD;
      respiratory physiotherapy (CRP) has an important role in the treatment and management of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. Airway cleaning techniques, approaches to reducing respiratory work, and&#xD;
      patient education form the basis of CRP and play an active role in the treatment and&#xD;
      management of the disease. In the literature, there are studies in which the effects of CRP&#xD;
      are given in both CF and NCFB patients and studies comparing evaluation results in both&#xD;
      groups without treatment. However, no study was found to compare the efficacy of CRP in these&#xD;
      two groups of diseases. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      differences between the efficacy of CRP among the groups in children with CF and NCFB.&#xD;
