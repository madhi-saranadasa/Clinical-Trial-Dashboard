      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group - Bronchiectasis that is not attributable to Cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - Pulmonary Rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - Standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size - 20 in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomised controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who qualify for the study will undergo a detailed evaluation. Baseline&#xD;
      assessment will include the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary Function Tests and Respiratory muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of dyspnoea (Dyspnoea scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limb muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory markers in the serum - C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomized (using table of random numbers) to either the pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation group or the standard arm group. After 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation,&#xD;
      patients will again be reassessed by the aforementioned tools.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study - Randomised controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period - March 2014 to July 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of study - Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders, All India Institute of&#xD;
      Medical Sciences, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group - Bronchiectasis that is not attributable to Cystic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - Standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size - 20 in each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires patients to attend the pulmonary rehabilitation program twice a week for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be taken from all patients prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbations of bronchiectasis will be defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least four of the following clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of an acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of bronchiectasis over two consecutive days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in sputum quantity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in sputum colour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in sputum viscosity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in cough&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in dyspnoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in fatigue/lethargy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever (self-reported)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Episode of haemoptysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of acute pulmonary exacerbations per year in the previous years will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients attending the out patient department of pulmonary department of All India&#xD;
      Institute of Medical Sciences will be screened for recruitment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who qualify for the study will undergo a detailed evaluation. This will include&#xD;
      demographic data, complete medical history and clinical examination including anthropometry.&#xD;
      Baseline assessment will include the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Anthropometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Pulmonary Function Tests and Respiratory muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Severity of dyspnoea (Dyspnoea scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Limb muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii. Inflammatory markers in the serum - C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
      viii. Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either standard care alone or&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation. The randomisation will be completed by the creation of a random&#xD;
      numbers table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates randomized to the &quot;standard care group&quot; will receive standard care for&#xD;
      bronchiectasis according to current guidelines. These participants will receive instruction&#xD;
      and review of airway clearance therapy (ACT). Each participant will be provided with written&#xD;
      information about bronchiectasis and education regarding self-management of the condition.&#xD;
      Participants who have not been previously instructed in any ACT will be taught the active&#xD;
      cycle of breathing technique. These participants will not receive any supervised exercise&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation group will receive exercise training&#xD;
      and regular instruction in self-management of ACT along with standard care. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the pulmonary rehabilitation programme, in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine&#xD;
      and Sleep disorders, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the programme would be 8 weeks, with thrice weekly sessions of exercise&#xD;
      training of 1 hour duration each. Of these sessions, at least 2 will be supervised while one&#xD;
      will be at home. The patient will be asked to maintain a personal log recording the date,&#xD;
      time, duration and type of exercise performed to ensure compliance, and these will be&#xD;
      regularly reviewed and monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rehabilitation Programme will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Patient education&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Exercise training&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Ventilator and breathing exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be reassessed at the end of the 8 week training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum exercise capacity - measured with the 6MWT (the primary outcome is the greatest&#xD;
           distance walked) and the CPET (VO2 max)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQoL measured with the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the C- reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the lung Functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the anxiety and depressions score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the hand grip dynamometry&#xD;
