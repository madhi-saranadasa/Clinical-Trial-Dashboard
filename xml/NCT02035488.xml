    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a persistent and frequently progressive condition characterized by dilated&#xD;
      and thick-walled bronchi retaining sputum. The main symptoms of bronchiectasis are cough and&#xD;
      chronic sputum production. Until now, most patients with non-CF bronchiectasis receive&#xD;
      inhaled tobramycin every other month, by use of a nebulizer. However, this delivery system&#xD;
      has several disadvantages, like a low lung deposition and pollution with tobramycin in the&#xD;
      surrounding environment. With an efficient dry powder inhaler (DPI), a three to six fold&#xD;
      higher lung deposition compared to a nebulizer can be obtained. Therapy with a DPI is also&#xD;
      less time consuming compared to nebulisation. We will investigate dry powder tobramycin (DP&#xD;
      tobramycin) in a novel device in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. The main objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of DP tobramycin at different&#xD;
      dosages together with the local tolerability of DP tobramycin via the Cyclops® at different&#xD;
      dosages.&#xD;

      Rationale: Bronchiectasis is a persistent and frequently progressive condition characterized&#xD;
      by dilated and thick-walled bronchi retaining sputum. The main symptoms of bronchiectasis are&#xD;
      cough and chronic sputum production. There is a state of constant colonization with bacteria,&#xD;
      which frequently causes exacerbations. The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an&#xD;
      unfavorable prognostic indicator and is associated with increased sputum production, more&#xD;
      extensive bronchiectasis on HR-CT of the thorax, more hospitalizations and reduced quality of&#xD;
      life. Until now, most patients with non-CF bronchiectasis who are colonized with P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa receive inhaled tobramycin every other month, by use of a nebulizer. However, this&#xD;
      delivery system has several disadvantages, like a low lung deposition and pollution with&#xD;
      tobramycin in the surrounding environment. With an efficient dry powder inhaler (DPI), a&#xD;
      three to six fold higher lung deposition compared to a nebulizer can be obtained. Therapy&#xD;
      with a DPI is also less time consuming compared to nebulisation. Nebulised tobramycin is used&#xD;
      most in routine care; there is also one, rather poorly characterized DPI for tobramycin&#xD;
      available, though this DPI is not registrered for non-CF bronchiectasis. We will investigate&#xD;
      dry powder tobramycin (DP tobramycin) in a novel device in patients with non-CF&#xD;
      bronchiectasis colonized with P. aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objectives are to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of DP&#xD;
      tobramycin at different dosages together with the local tolerability of DP tobramycin via the&#xD;
      Cyclops® at different dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: single center, single ascending, single dose, response study. Study population:&#xD;
      8 patients with non-CF bronchiectasis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated: actual dose (dose minus&#xD;
      remainder in inhaler after inhalation), AUC0-12 (area under the curve from 0 -12 h), Cmax&#xD;
      (maximum plasma concentration), Tmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), Ka (absorption&#xD;
      rate constant), T1/2 el (terminal elimination half-life), CL/F (clearance following pulmonary&#xD;
      administration (F= bioavailability)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local tolerability of DP tobramycin is determined by scoring adverse events, specifically&#xD;
      coughing, and lung function measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: All participants included in this study are patients recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient department of pulmonology. To investigate safety, lung function tests will be&#xD;
      performed and the occurrence of adverse events will be scored.&#xD;
