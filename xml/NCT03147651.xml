      Introduction: Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease in which the underlying condition&#xD;
      causes permanent damage to the conducting airways. Bronchiectasis is associated with&#xD;
      considerable morbidity and poor quality of life. While cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most&#xD;
      common cause of bronchiectasis in childhood, non-CF bronchiectasis is associated with a wide&#xD;
      variety of disorders. CF bronchiectasis patients show reduced daily habitual physical&#xD;
      activity and exercise capacity. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is increasingly gaining&#xD;
      importance in clinical medicine and considered the gold standard exercise test for assessing&#xD;
      aerobic exercise capacity. The test objectively evaluates exercise physiological functions,&#xD;
      may help assess morbidity and predict the outcome and mortality in different clinical&#xD;
      circumstances and may serve as a basis for individualized exercise prescription within the&#xD;
      limitation of the disease. Unlike CPET in CF, there is a paucity of data on exercise capacity&#xD;
      using CPET in non- CF bronchiectasis patients, and on the implications of physical activity&#xD;
      on non- CF bronchiectasis morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate and compare exercise capacity in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a cross-sectional retrospective/prospective study population. The&#xD;
      retrospective study will include data analysis of patients that preformed CPET as part of&#xD;
      their clinical evaluation. In the prospective study, patients that are scheduled to perform&#xD;
      CPET as part of their clinical evaluation will sign (or legal guardian) informed consent&#xD;
      prior to participation. Patients will be recruited from the exercise clinic at the Pediatric&#xD;
      Pulmonary Institute at the Rappaport Children's Hospital. Inclusion criteria: 1. Children and&#xD;
      adults (age &gt;7 years, height &gt;125cm), with CF and non CF bronchiectasis. 2. Completed a&#xD;
      maximal CPET test according to accepted criteria; (maximal VO2 &gt; 80% predicted, maximal heart&#xD;
      rate &gt; 80% predicted, acceptable RER (RER &gt; 1.0 in children (under 18 years), RER &gt; 1.05 for&#xD;
      adults) or reaching a VO2 plateau..3. Evidence of bronchiectasis in computed tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions criteria: preforming submaximal CPET, lack of data from the exercise test,&#xD;
      exacerbation of patient's condition within three days before the exercise evaluation,&#xD;
      relevant related chronic diseases that affecting test results.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease in which the underlying condition causes permanent&#xD;
      damage to the conducting airways. Bronchiectasis is associated with considerable morbidity&#xD;
      and poor quality of life. Patients with respiratory diseases show reduced daily functional&#xD;
      physical ability (habitual physical activity). Reasons may be due to pulmonary limitation (in&#xD;
      severe diseases), peripheral muscular changes or due to secondary factors such as&#xD;
      deconditioning or overly cautious caregivers restraining patient's physical activity.&#xD;
      Deconditioning due to reduced habitual activity leads to further reduction in exercise&#xD;
      capacity increasing the severity of their condition. While CF is the most common cause of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis in childhood, non-CF bronchiectasis is associated with a wide variety of&#xD;
      disorders. The etiology for non-CF bronchiectasis include: primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD),&#xD;
      post infectious, aspiration, primary and secondary immunodeficiency, congenital malformation,&#xD;
      and others. Children with CF tend to perform poorly at a moderate-intensity physical activity&#xD;
      compared to non-CF children of same age. In the last several decades, exercise has been&#xD;
      encouraged in CF patients to improve sputum expectoration and lung function. There is&#xD;
      evidence that exercise in addition to respiratory physical therapy, improves lung function&#xD;
      and reduces the rate of lung function deterioration, compared with respiratory physical&#xD;
      therapy alone. Another study showed that an aerobic training program in children contributed&#xD;
      to significantly higher peak aerobic capacity, activity level, and subjective quality of life&#xD;
      than children who received a resistance training program. In conclusion, higher levels of&#xD;
      physical activity in addition to good muscular and pulmonary functions are associated with a&#xD;
      high aerobic capacity in cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact physiologic mechanism by which exercise improves clearing of airways&#xD;
      secretions in CF is not entirely clear, possible explanations are attributed to increased&#xD;
      airflow and mechanical clearing of mucus. Following physical exertion there is an increase in&#xD;
      tidal volume and respiratory flow to meet tissue demands. Increasing peak expiratory flow&#xD;
      (PEF) to peak inspiratory flow (PIF) ratio may help drive the mucus past the oropharynx to&#xD;
      clear more easily. Additional benefits of exercise in patients with CF are similar to the&#xD;
      healthy population and includes overall improvement in cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal&#xD;
      health, and quality of life. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2peak) serves as a strong&#xD;
      prognosis marker associated with an approximate 8-year survival in CF patients and correlates&#xD;
      with the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory exacerbations. There is paucity of&#xD;
      data regarding exercise capacity in non-CF bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research Aim: To evaluate and compare exercise capacity in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Significance: There is limited data regarding exercise capability in non-CF&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. CPET is increasingly gaining importance in clinical medicine. The test helps&#xD;
      the clinician objectively evaluate the physiological functions, may help predict the outcome&#xD;
      and mortality in different clinical circumstances and may serve as a basis for creating&#xD;
      individualized exercise prescription within the context and limitation of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Research Plan: Design: cross-sectional retrospective/prospective study population. The&#xD;
      retrospective study will include data analysis of patients that preformed exercise tests as&#xD;
      part of their clinical evaluation. In the prospective study, informed consent will be sign by&#xD;
      the patient or legal guardian prior to participation. Setting: Outpatient clinic. The aim is&#xD;
      to evaluate 50 patients with CF and 50 non-CF bronchiectasis patients from the exercise&#xD;
      clinic at the Pediatric Pulmonary Institute at the Rappaport Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 1. Children and adults (age &gt;7 years, height &gt;125cm , with CF and non CF&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. 2. Completed a maximal CPET test according to accepted criteria; (maximal VO2&#xD;
      &gt; 80% predicted, maximal heart rate &gt; 80% predicted, acceptable RER (RER &gt; 1.0 in children&#xD;
      (under 18 years), RER &gt; 1.05 for adults) or reaching a VO2 plateau .&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Evidence of bronchiectasis in computed tomography (CT); followed at the Pediatric&#xD;
      Pulmonary Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions criteria: preforming submaximal CPET, lack of data from the exercise test,&#xD;
      exacerbation of patient's condition within three days before the exercise evaluation,&#xD;
      relevant related chronic diseases that affecting test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic has performed tests in over 1500 adolescents, children and adults, most commonly&#xD;
      who have chronic illness such as congestive heart failure (CHD), CF, PCD, post oncological&#xD;
      diseases, diabetes, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, sex, height and weight, etiology of bronchiectasis, and chest CT will be recorded. Body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) will be calculated. Each patient will fill a questionnaire regarding his&#xD;
      life style and exercise capability in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPET: Following baseline measures, each patient will undergo CPET using cycle ergometer&#xD;
      (Cosmed, Rome, Italy). Silicone face masks will be harnessed over the subject's nose and&#xD;
      mouth to monitor the resting and exercise gas exchange measurements. Subjects are connected&#xD;
      to electrocardiogram (ECG), saturation and blood pressure monitors. Exercise time is 8-12&#xD;
      minutes and total test duration is 45-60 minutes. The test is non-invasive and within the&#xD;
      limits of the test, it is safe. The test begins with a no resistance warm up lasting 1 to 3&#xD;
      minutes and followed with a gradual increment in resistance adapted to the patient's&#xD;
      functional capacities according to the examiner's free judgment and ranging 5 to 25&#xD;
      Watts/minute. Pulmonary function tests rest will be recorded prior to CPET and 10 minutes&#xD;
      post exercise. The cardio-respiratory parameters measured include respiration rate (RR),&#xD;
      heart rate by 12-lead ECG (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure (BP), tidal volume&#xD;
      (TV), minute ventilation (VE), breathing reserve (BR), oxygen consumption (VO2), VCO2 (carbon&#xD;
      dioxide flow rejected by the ventilation system), respiratory equivalents (VE/VO2, VE/VCO2),&#xD;
      end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), anaerobic threshold (AT), oxygen pulse (O2 pulse),&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at rest, during exercise and recovery . The combination of&#xD;
      data collected allows analysis of the subject's ability during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry: Spirometry will be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS (American Thoracic&#xD;
      Society/ European Respiratory Society) Task Force using a KoKo spirometer (KoKo system, PDS&#xD;
      Inc., Ferraris Cardiopulmonary System Group; Louisville, CO, USA). Each maneuver will be&#xD;
      repeated for at least three technically acceptable; the best results were used for analysis.&#xD;
