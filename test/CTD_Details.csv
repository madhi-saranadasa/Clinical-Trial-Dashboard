      Some studies have concluded that high-dose inhaled steroids (IS) are effective in the
      clinical control of patients with bronchiectasis, however the high doses needed provokes some
      adverse effects and lower doses are not effective. Combined treatment with budesonide and
      formoterol have demostrated to be effective in patients with asthma and COPD achieving the
      reduction of steroid dose thanks to the adition of a long-acting beta 2 agonists. There are
      no studies in the literature analysing the effect of combined treatment in patients with
      bronchiectasis. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      formoterol-medium dose of budesonide in a single inhaler versus high-dose of budesonide in
      the clinical control of patientes with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

      Bronchiectasis is a chronic chest condition which causes a persistent cough and frequent
      chest infections. One of the main forms of treatment is chest physiotherapy. Physiotherapy is
      thought to improve cough and help clear the airways of sticky sputum. Traditionally,
      physiotherapy techniques can be awkward, but recently a new device (a simple mouthpiece,
      called the Acapella device) has been developed to make physiotherapy practise easier. This
      study aims to assess how helpful regular physiotherapy using a new mouthpiece is in patients
      with severe bronchiectasis.

      Statins are a class of drug used to prevent heart attacks and strokes by lowering blood
      cholesterol levels. They have also been found to have a beneficial ""side effect"" of lowering
      the level of inflammation in the body. This is thought to be one of the reasons they are
      effective in treating heart attacks and strokes. Laboratory experiments have shown that
      statins reduce lung inflammation in response to bacteria and this is a promising development
      for the treatment of chest infections.

      Bronchiectasis is a chronic disabling lung disease characterised by chronic sputum production
      and recurrent chest infections. 2/3 of patients are chronically colonised with bacteria
      (normally the lungs are sterile) and this leads inflammation in the lung and in the rest of
      the body.

      There are no effective treatments for bronchiectasis other than antibiotics for chest
      infections. With increasing antibiotic use, there is increasing antibiotic resistance and new
      treatments for this disease are needed.

      The investigators intend to study Atorvastatin in patients with bronchiectasis with
      colonization with pseudomonas aeruginosa. The investigators will give Atorvastatin to 16
      patients with this disease while 16 patients will receive placebo. This will be a crossover
      study where patients will receive atorvastatin or placebo for 3 months, followed by a statin
      wash out period of 6 weeks. Thereafter the groups will cross over and the group receiving
      atorvastatin will now receive placebo and those receiving placebo will receive atorvastatin
      for 3 months. The investigators will measure inflammation in their lungs and in the rest of
      their body before and after treatment with atorvastatin. The investigators will also assess
      their quality of life and number of chest infections over a 7.5 month period.

      This pilot study will determine if there is any role for statins are an anti-inflammatory
      agent in patients with bronchiectasis.

      Bronchiectasis is a persistent and frequently progressive condition characterized by dilated
      and thick-walled bronchi retaining sputum. The main symptoms of bronchiectasis are cough and
      chronic sputum production. Until now, most patients with non-CF bronchiectasis receive
      inhaled tobramycin every other month, by use of a nebulizer. However, this delivery system
      has several disadvantages, like a low lung deposition and pollution with tobramycin in the
      surrounding environment. With an efficient dry powder inhaler (DPI), a three to six fold
      higher lung deposition compared to a nebulizer can be obtained. Therapy with a DPI is also
      less time consuming compared to nebulisation. We will investigate dry powder tobramycin (DP
      tobramycin) in a novel device in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. The main objectives of
      this study are to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of DP tobramycin at different
      dosages together with the local tolerability of DP tobramycin via the Cyclops® at different

33,NCT02531984,Assistance Publique Hopitaux De Marseille,Randomized,The Efficacy of Azithromycin in Treating Children With Non Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis,"
      Bronchiectasis is characterized by a permanent and abnormal dilatation of a part of the
      bronchial tree. An accumulation of mucus in the respiratory tract ensues, resulting in
      frequent bacterial infections and eventual destruction of the lungs. Clinically, patients
      present with a chronic productive cough and episodes of acute respiratory exacerbations.
      Chronic respiratory failure can follow. Although its prevalence is largely unknown,
      bronchiectasis is considered to be a rare and orphan disease. There are numerous causes for
      this disease: sequelae of respiratory infections, immunodeficiency, genetic diseases like
      cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia….The focus of this study will be on non cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis in children.

      Due to a lack of pediatric clinical trials, the management of children with this disease is
      widely based on the management of adults or patients with cystic fibrosis or
      pan-bronchiolitis. The treatment is based on respiratory physiotherapy, prevention of
      infections, administration of inhaled corticosteroids and anti biotherapy for acute
      exacerbations.

      Recently, some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a family of antibiotics, the
      macrolides, in the treatment of cystic fibrosis or pan-bronchiolitis in children. Indeed,
      taken 3 times a week during a long period of time, the macrolides, and specifically the
      azithromycin have shown some anti-inflammatory and tissue repairing properties, in addition
      to their antimicrobial properties.

      Moreover, several studies conducted in the adult population have shown that the use of
      azithromycin has led to significant reduction in the frequency of respiratory exacerbations
      as well as an improvement in the quality of life.

      The efficacy of azithromycin in these respiratory diseases has led to enlarge its use for the
      long term treatment of bronchiectasis. Yet, this type of treatment has no marketing
      authorization application.

      No studies have been conducted in children, but individual examination of patients with
      bronchiectasis treated with azithromycin suggests an improvement of their symptoms.

      Thus, the use of azithromycin in the treatment of bronchiectasis in children seems to be a
      promising therapy. However, its efficacy needs to be demonstrated by clinical trials led on a
      pediatric population with an adequate number of patients and a strong methodology in order to
      ensure validity and reliability of the results.

      Therefore the investigators decided to conduct a comparative, prospective multicenter
      randomized study in this population.

      This study intends to include 100 patients already treated by azithromycin for at least 6
      months. After inclusion, they will be randomized in two groups of 50 patients each. The first
      group will continue the treatment and the other one will discontinue it.

      The patients will be followed from the inclusion period (M0) until the onset of the first
      exacerbation for a maximum of 6 months (M6), with an intermediate health care visit after 3
      months (M3).

      In case of exacerbation, a health care visit will be scheduled; the patient will receive the
      appropriate treatment and he will be suspended from the study.

      The duration of follow up for each patient is dictated by the occurrence of the first
      respiratory exacerbation, a maximum of 6 months .The total inclusion period is 12 months and
      the total duration of the study is 18 months.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are part of the multidisciplinary treatment of some chronic
      respiratory diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Although clinical
      guidelines of other diseases such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (nCFBE) discuss the
      benefits of these programs in quality of life and exercise tolerance, evidence of such
      intervention in nCFBE patients is insufficient. Longer studies are needed with larger sample
      sizes and optimized to maximize the response and maintain long-term benefits. The present
      study aims to examine the effects in exercise tolerance of a pulmonary rehabilitation program
      combined with respiratory physiotherapy in patients with nCFBE. It is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial with a total duration of 24 months. The intervention will be performed during
      12 weeks and then will be a period of 12 months of maintenance. This is a multicenter study
      involving the following Hospitals: Hospital Clinic, Hospital la Plató and Hospital del Mar of

45,NCT03147651,Rambam Health Care Campus,,Exercise Capacity in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis vs. Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis,"
      Introduction: Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease in which the underlying condition
      causes permanent damage to the conducting airways. Bronchiectasis is associated with
      considerable morbidity and poor quality of life. While cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most
      common cause of bronchiectasis in childhood, non-CF bronchiectasis is associated with a wide
      variety of disorders. CF bronchiectasis patients show reduced daily habitual physical
      activity and exercise capacity. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is increasingly gaining
      importance in clinical medicine and considered the gold standard exercise test for assessing
      aerobic exercise capacity. The test objectively evaluates exercise physiological functions,
      may help assess morbidity and predict the outcome and mortality in different clinical
      circumstances and may serve as a basis for individualized exercise prescription within the
      limitation of the disease. Unlike CPET in CF, there is a paucity of data on exercise capacity
      using CPET in non- CF bronchiectasis patients, and on the implications of physical activity
      on non- CF bronchiectasis morbidity and mortality.

      Aim: To evaluate and compare exercise capacity in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients.

      Methods: This will be a cross-sectional retrospective/prospective study population. The
      retrospective study will include data analysis of patients that preformed CPET as part of
      their clinical evaluation. In the prospective study, patients that are scheduled to perform
      CPET as part of their clinical evaluation will sign (or legal guardian) informed consent
      prior to participation. Patients will be recruited from the exercise clinic at the Pediatric
      Pulmonary Institute at the Rappaport Children's Hospital. Inclusion criteria: 1. Children and
      adults (age >7 years, height >125cm), with CF and non CF bronchiectasis. 2. Completed a

      This is a single-arm, open label, Phase II study of Roflumilast in stable-state non-cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis subjects.

      Bronchiectasis refers to a suppurative lung condition characterized by pathological
      dilatation of bronchi. The predominant aetiology of bronchiectasis in the Western population
      is related to cystic fibrosis (CF), which is genetically determined. Bronchiectasis due to
      other causes are generally grouped under the term ""non-CF bronchiectasis"", which accounts for
      practically all cases that are seen commonly in Hong Kong and many other Chinese populations.

      The main pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis involves airway inflammation, abnormal mucus
      clearance and bacterial colonization, resulting in progressive airway destruction and
      distortion. The current treatment strategies mainly focus on targeting the key elements in
      the pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis.

      In patients with bronchiectasis, there is also neutrophilic inflammation as in COPD. It is
      hypothesized that roflumilast can improve airway inflammation, sputum volume and sputum
      inflammatory markers in patients with bronchiectasis.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of short-term (4-week) treatment with roflumilast
      on neutrophilic airway inflammation in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis.

      a pulmonary exacerbation (defined as a change in one or more of the following: cough; sputum

      The study will recruit ten adult subjects (male and female) who attend the Cambridge Centre
      for Lung Infection (CCLI) at the Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom. The
      study will include individuals with a known diagnosis of bronchiectasis suffering a current
      pulmonary exacerbation. Participants seen during their usual clinic review with an
      exacerbation will be invited to participate and enrolled to commence the study that same day
      (day 0). Participants enrolled will undergo clinical review and a series of standard-of-care
      testing including sputum culture, lung function tests and blood analysis. Additional to these
      standard investigations, participants will also undertake a series of patient reported
      outcomes via validated respiratory questionnaires (Quality of Life - Bronchiectasis - QOL-B;
      & Leicester Cough Questionnaire - LCQ) and functional respiratory imaging (FRI). FRI consists
      of low dose high-resolution CT at full inspiration and expiration, combined with
      computational fluid dynamic testing.

      Participants will be treated without delay according to standard of care treatment as per
      current international guidelines. Participants may be treated as either an inpatient or
      outpatient determined by the treating respiratory physician.

      Follow up will occur on day 7, 14 and 28 post enrolment with serial CT imaging on days 0, 14
      and 28. No scheduled follow up testing will be required beyond the day 28 visit, however all
      participants will receive a follow-up phone call at day 35.

      The investigators hypothesize that changes in FRI parameters will be seen pre and post
      exacerbation treatment and will correlate with changes in lung function and patient reported
      outcomes. This will confirm FRI as a surrogate biomarker for assessing therapeutic response
      in future clinical trials in bronchiectasis.

50,NCT03988816,University of Sao Paulo General Hospital,Randomized,"Effect of Roflumilast on Quality of Life, Lung Function and Mucus Properties in Patients With Bronchiectasis","
      Although relatively common, bronchiectasis is considered an orphan disease as there is little
      evidence for adequate treatment, most of the therapeutic options are extrapolated from
      studies with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis
      (CF). Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids should be used as a therapeutic test and
      maintained if there is improvement of symptoms or lung function. There is no evidence to
      justify the use of mucolytic agents for these patients. The treatment with greater evidence
      is the use of macrolides, especially azithromycin. A meta-analysis published in 2014 showed
      that there was a reduction in the number of exacerbations, an improvement in the quality of
      life and a reduction in the decrease in FEV1. However, studies have shown conflicting results
      regarding quality of life and pulmonary function.

      Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and
      in vivo due to the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monopostat breakdown (cAMP) to its inactive
      phosphodiesterase form. As this enzyme is expressed in high concentrations in leukocytes and
      other inflammatory cells responsible for the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as COPD,
      it has been studied and used for this disease. COPD is characterized by a chronic
      inflammatory process of the airways, predominantly neutrophils and high levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines related to this cell, such as interleukin-8, neutrophil elastase,
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and E-selectin. The REACT study showed that roflumilast
      prevents moderate and severe infectious exacerbations in addition to improved lung function
      in patients with COPD who continue to exacerbate despite the use of combined bronchodilator
      and inhaled corticosteroid therapy.

      Since bronchiectasis and COPD are chronic inflammatory diseases, they present similar
      inflammatory processes, with neutrophil as the main inflammatory cell, it is expected that
      the use of roflumilast also has an anti-inflammatory effect in bronchiectasis. In addition,
      since bronchiectasis is a disease with poor evidence for pharmacological treatment, it is
      necessary to search for new therapeutic possibilities.

      This is a single-arm, open label, Phase II study of 12-week use of Roflumilast in
      stable-state non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis subjects.

      Bronchiectasis refers to a suppurative lung condition characterized by pathological
      dilatation of bronchi. The predominant aetiology of bronchiectasis in the Western population
      is related to cystic fibrosis (CF), which is genetically determined. Bronchiectasis due to
      other causes are generally grouped under the term ""non-CF bronchiectasis"", which accounts for
      practically all cases that are seen commonly in Hong Kong and many other Chinese populations.

      The main pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis involves airway inflammation, abnormal mucus
      clearance and bacterial colonization, resulting in progressive airway destruction and
      distortion. This destructive process perpetuates in a vicious circle even when the initial
      insult has subsided, which is commonly due to an infective process like tuberculosis in Hong
      Kong. Patients with extensive bronchiectasis present with chronic cough, copious purulent
      sputum, haemoptysis, progressive lung function loss, and episodes of infective exacerbations.

      The current treatment strategies mainly focus on targeting the key elements in the
      pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis. Apart from regular chest physiotherapy and postural
      drainage to help clearing mucus from bronchiectatic airways, inhalational and parenteral
      antibiotics have also been used to reduce the bacterial load in destroyed airways, thus
      controlling and preventing infective exacerbations. In recent years, accumulated evidence has
      suggested a central role of airway inflammation and immune dysregulation in the evolution of
      non-CF bronchiectasis.

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive destructive process on exposure
      to noxious environmental agents (e.g. tobacco smoke) that affects both the airways (chronic
      bronchitis) and lung parenchyma (emphysema), leading to loss of lung function and exercise
      capacity. Both COPD and bronchiectasis share similarities in clinical presentation and
      pathogenetic mechanisms. Neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial colonization are also the
      cornerstone in the airways of patients with COPD. Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)
      inhibitor, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in COPD resulting in reduction in
      exacerbation frequency. This is the first-in-class and the only one clinically available PDE4
      inhibitor that is approved worldwide (including Hong Kong) for treatment of severe COPD with
      frequent exacerbations.

      At the time of writing, the exact role and clinical evidence for roflumilast in dampening
      airway inflammation in non-CF bronchiectasis is still lacking. Given the common pathogenetic
      mechanism via neutrophilic inflammation between non-CF bronchiectasis and COPD, as well as
      the robust clinical activity of roflumilast in COPD, this study is designed to provide
      initial scientific evidence on the activity of roflumilast on neutrophilic airway
      inflammation in patients with stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of 12-week treatment with roflumilast on
      neutrophilic airway inflammation in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis.

      This study is open to adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The main purpose of
      this study is to find out how a medicine called BI 1323495 is tolerated by people with
      non-cystic bronchiectasis.

      The study tests 2 different doses of BI 1323495. Some of the participants get placebo. It is
      decided by chance who gets BI 1323495 and who gets placebo. Participants take BI 1323495 or
      placebo as tablets twice a day for 3 months. Placebo tablets look like BI 1323495 tablets but
      do not contain any medicine. Participants can also continue taking standard medicines for
      noncystic bronchiectasis throughout the study.

      Participants are in the study for about 4 months. During this time, the participants visit
      the study site about 11 times and get about 2 phone calls. At the visits, doctors check the
      health of the participants and note any health problems that could have been caused by BI
      1323495.
